## Overview

A puppeting bridge between Matrix and Signal packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, notifications (and sometimes media) are bridged between a Signal user and a Matrix user.
Currently the Matrix user can NOT invite other Matrix user in a bridged Signal room, so only someone with a Signal account can participate to Signal group conversations.

The ["Mautrix-Signal"](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/signal/index.html) bridge consists in a Synapse App Service and relies on postgresql (mysql also possible). Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should be installed beforehand.


**Shipped version:** 0.6.0~ynh1
